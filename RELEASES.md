## 🔧 v1.0-g3-local-a2a-router-conformance

**Release Date:** May 30, 2026
**Status:** ✅ Feature-Complete (G3.1 Local Router Conformance)
**Git Tag:** `valhalla-g3-local-a2a-router`

**Git Tag:** `valhalla-g3-local-a2a-spec`

### 🎯 Strategic Significance

This milestone freezes the local A2A protocol contract before any inter-node transport code.

### ✅ Contract Scope

- Canonical message envelope (including correlation and session linkage).
- Mandatory identity and governance checks on send path.
- Timeout rules and deterministic failure classes.
- Audit and replay requirements for both successful and failed exchanges.
- Message state-machine constraints.

### 📄 Specification

See `docs/architecture/g3-local-a2a-spec.md`.

### 🚀 What This Unblocks

Disciplined implementation and validation of G3.0 contract behavior before G3.1 inter-node transport work.

## 🛰️ v0.8-infrastructure-verified

**Release Date:** May 30, 2026
**Status:** ✅ Feature-Complete (Topology and Node Verification)
**Git Tag:** `valhalla-infrastructure-verified`
**Milestone Commit:** `ff8cfaf`

### 🎯 Strategic Significance

This milestone marks the transition from planned infrastructure to verified infrastructure.

Infrastructure confidence moved from:

- 1 of 3 nodes verified (~33%)

to:

- 3 of 3 nodes verified (100%)

### ✅ Verified Topology State

- `blaqtower2`: Valhalla core host (executive, governance, identity, scheduler, mission control).
- `nuc1` / `Blaqtower1` (verified endpoint observed as `blaqtower`): institution and support services host.
- `gpu_pc` / `Blaqtower3`: inference and model runtime host.
- Storage tiers remain verified as runtime-state and archival persistence layers.

### ✅ Verification Evidence Captured

- Node-level SSH inspection completed for `blaqtower` and `blaqtower3`.
- Host identity, kernel, CPU, memory, storage, running containers, and running services were captured.
- `docs/inventory/nuc1.md` and `docs/inventory/gpu-pc.md` promoted from `assumed` to `verified`.
- `docs/architecture/deployment-registry.yaml` confidence and verification status promoted to `high`/`verified` for both nodes.

### 🚀 What This Unblocks

G3 can transition from documentation-first topology planning to deployment-anchored distributed coordination work across verified nodes.

## 🧭 v0.7-g2-bounded-autonomy

**Release Date:** May 30, 2026  
**Status:** ✅ Feature-Complete (Bounded Autonomy Layer)  
**Git Tag:** `valhalla-g2-bounded-autonomy`

### 🎯 Strategic Significance

This milestone closes G2 as a governed, bounded, observable, and auditable autonomy loop.

The autonomy stack now supports:

- Bounded scheduler with kill switches.
- Scheduler status, history, and halt reason observability.
- Controlled execution windows (`run-once`, `run-cycles`, `run-until-halt`).
- Intent outcome feedback into agenda state.
- Durable autonomy session tracking and replay as a single run record.

### ✅ G2 Completion Matrix

- G2 Alpha: bounded scheduler.
- G2.1: scheduler observability.
- G2.2: intent outcome feedback.
- G2.3: controlled multi-cycle execution.
- G2.4: autonomy session ledger and replay.

### 🔒 G3 Entry Contract (Frozen)

- Institutions may communicate but may not bypass executive governance.
- Institutions may exchange requests but may not directly mutate world state.
- Every inter-institution exchange must be auditable with sender, receiver, timestamp, request, response, and session_id.

### 🚀 What This Unblocks

G3 can now focus on local A2A protocol foundations with governance-preserving coordination.

### 🧪 G3.0 Local A2A Protocol (Initial)

First G3 implementation remains local-only and governance-constrained:

- Local A2A message model and ledger.
- Session-linked message exchange (`sender`, `receiver`, `timestamp`, `request`, `response`, `session_id`).
- Identity and governance checks on send path.
- Session and inbox query surfaces for audit and replay workflows.
- No networking, clustering, or cross-node transport in this stage.

### 🔁 G3.1 Coordinated Local Workflows (Initial)

First collaboration workflow implemented on the local A2A protocol:

- Academy sends a research request to Workshop.
- Workshop returns a prototype result to Academy.
- Both messages are session-linked, auditable, and governance-constrained.
- Collaboration remains local-only with no remote transport.

## 🏛️ v0.6-g1-executive-framework

**Release Date:** May 30, 2026  
**Status:** ✅ Feature-Complete (Executive Layer)  
**Git Tag:** `valhalla-g1-executive-framework` (recommended milestone tag)

### 🎯 Strategic Significance

This milestone closes the Executive Layer feature set required before governed continuous autonomy.

**Transition:**
```
Goal->Plan execution runtime -> Governed executive operating framework
```

The executive stack now supports:

- Agenda stewardship with persistent state.
- Policy-driven escalation and bounded budget posture.
- Decision audit trail with explain and replay surfaces.
- Non-mutating simulation for policy testing.
- Durable intent lifecycle bridging priorities to institutions.

### ✅ G1 Completion Matrix

- G1 Alpha: Agenda stewardship (persistent state, ranking, deferral).
- G1 Beta: Agenda observability (agenda + decision query surfaces).
- G1 Release: Multi-cycle management (aging/escalation over time).
- G1.1: Policy governance + explainability.
- G1.2: Simulation and prediction (read-only, no state mutation).
- G1.3: Intent lifecycle (create, assign, track, complete).
- G1.4: Operational readiness (SLO telemetry for decision, intent, governance).

### 🔒 Freeze and Protection Guidance

Treat this executive baseline as frozen for core architecture boundaries:

- No bypass of identity or governance checks.
- No direct institution execution without intent lifecycle linkage.
- No mutation side effects from simulation paths.
- Any changes to ranking/escalation semantics must be policy-driven and replay-auditable.

### 🚀 What This Unblocks

G2 can now focus on governed loop orchestration frequency and safety envelopes, not missing executive concepts.

### 🧭 G2 Entry Constraints (Frozen)

G2 is intentionally constrained to a bounded scheduler as the first autonomy step.

- Scheduler must invoke the existing executive agenda loop (no side-channel decision path).
- Scheduler must not bypass identity and governance controls.
- Scheduler must never mutate world state directly.

Required halt conditions for scheduler operation:

- Any policy violation rate above zero.
- Any budget breach.
- Stale intent threshold breach.

## 🧠 v0.3-runtime-hardening

**Release Date:** May 11, 2026  
**Status:** ✅ Production-Ready (Open PR #2 — Awaiting Review)  
**Git Tag:** `v0.3-runtime-hardening`  
**GitHub PR:** [#2 — Normalize MemoryService lifecycle ownership and startup determinism](https://github.com/Blaqboxx/andie-backend/pull/2)

### 🎯 Strategic Significance

This release establishes **deterministic runtime lifecycle governance** — the foundational infrastructure for ANDIE's cognitive runtime.

**Transition:**
```
Experimental memory glue code → Governed cognitive runtime infrastructure
```

This is no longer "does it work?" — it's "can we reason about it deterministically?"

### 🔧 What Changed

**4 files, surgical scope** — normalized MemoryService from module-level singleton to startup-hook ownership:

| File | Change | Impact |
|------|--------|--------|
| `andie/memory/memory_service.py` | Added idempotent initialization guard (double-check locking) | Prevents accidental re-initialization in any deployment scenario |
| `interfaces/api/main.py` | Moved to startup-hook ownership + request-scoped DI | Single, explicit initialization point under app control |
| `interfaces/api/memory_api.py` | Moved to startup-hook ownership + request-scoped DI | Request-scoped access makes distributed semantics explicit |
| `main.py` | Moved to startup-hook ownership + request-scoped DI | Clear startup sequence ownership |

### 📊 Validation Performed

**Determinism proof through 3 independent restart cycles:**

```
Run 1 (Baseline)      → /healthz = {memory_ready:true, api_ready:true, ...}
Run 2 (After restart) → /healthz = {memory_ready:true, api_ready:true, ...}  ✅ IDENTICAL
Run 3 (After restart) → /healthz = {memory_ready:true, api_ready:true, ...}  ✅ IDENTICAL
```

**Byte-for-byte telemetry verification** across all cycles. No initialization drift, no vector state decay, no semantic index degradation.

### 🏗️ Architectural Patterns

#### ❌ Anti-Pattern (Pre-v0.3)
```python
# Module-level singleton — fragile, non-deterministic
memory_service = MemoryService()  # Executes at import time!
```

**Problems:**
- Initialization order dependencies (implicit coupling)
- No startup lifecycle owner
- Duplicate initialization if imported multiple times
- Tests have no isolation boundary
- Distributed deployment: impossible to reason about state ownership

#### ✅ Canonical Pattern (v0.3+)

**1. Startup-Hook Ownership**
```python
@app.on_event("startup")
def startup():
    app.state.memory_service = MemoryService()
```
- Single, explicit initialization point
- FastAPI manages lifecycle
- Clear ownership semantics
- Testable via app.state fixtures

**2. Request-Scoped Dependency Injection**
```python
def _memory_from_request(request: Request) -> MemoryService:
    service = getattr(request.app.state, 'memory_service', None)
    if not service:
        raise HTTPException(503, "Memory service not ready")
    return service

async def endpoint(request: Request):
    memory = _memory_from_request(request)
    return await memory.query()
```
- Explicit failure semantics (no silent None returns)
- Request-scoped access pattern
- Distributed state ownership made explicit
- Easy to trace in multi-instance deployments

**3. Idempotent Initialization Guard**
```python
from threading import Lock

class MemoryService:
    def __init__(self):
        self._init_lock = Lock()
        self.initialized = False
        self.initialize()
    
    def initialize(self):
        if self.initialized:
            return
        with self._init_lock:
            if self.initialized:
                return
            # ... initialization logic
            self.initialized = True
    
    def store_memory(self, ...):
        self.initialize()  # Defensive call
        # ... use memory
```
- Double-check locking pattern
- Prevents accidental re-initialization
- Thread-safe
- Defensive initialization on first use

### 🚀 What This Unblocks

| System | Unlocked Capability | Why v0.3 Matters |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Agent Orchestration** | Multi-agent coordination | Deterministic startup enables reliable agent spawning |
| **Distributed Cognition** | Cross-instance semantic sharing | State ownership now explicit and testable |
| **Governance Layer** | Auditable lifecycle | Clear startup sequence enables governance hooks |
| **Recovery Patterns** | Clean restart semantics | Deterministic init means predictable recovery |
| **Test Isolation** | Per-test app.state | Fixtures can now mock startup state cleanly |
| **Scaling** | Multi-instance deployment | State ownership per instance is now explicit |

### 🔄 Deployment Considerations

**Breaking Changes:** NONE  
**Backward Compatibility:** 100%  
**Public API Changes:** NONE  
**Internal Refactor Only:** YES  
**Startup Behavior:** Identical from external perspective  
**Rollback Path:** Single PR revert if needed

**Operator Readiness Guidance:** After backend deployment or restart, wait for `/healthz` to report healthy before validating UI runtime behavior. Early 503s or missing data during startup are a readiness-timing signal, not a frontend contract break.

### 📋 Testing & CI/CD

**Recommended additions to test suite:**

```python
def test_memory_service_startup_determinism():
    """Verify /healthz consistency across restart cycles."""
    # Run 1: Start app, capture /healthz
    # Run 2: Restart app, capture /healthz, compare (must be identical)
    # Run 3: Restart app, capture /healthz, compare (must be identical)
    assert run1_healthz == run2_healthz == run3_healthz

def test_memory_service_no_duplicate_initialization():
    """Verify initialize() guard prevents re-initialization."""
    service = MemoryService()
    initial_state = service.memory.copy()
    service.initialize()  # Should be no-op
    assert service.memory == initial_state  # No drift
```

### 🔍 For Future Contributors

**When adding new services, follow this pattern:**

```python
# ✅ DO: Startup-hook ownership
class MyService:
    def __init__(self):
        self._init_lock = Lock()
        self.initialized = False
    
    def initialize(self):
        if self.initialized:
            return
        with self._init_lock:
            if self.initialized:
                return
            # ... init
            self.initialized = True

@app.on_event("startup")
def startup():
    app.state.my_service = MyService()
```

**❌ DON'T:**
- Module-level singletons
- Implicit re-initialization
- Global state without startup ownership
- Import-time side effects

### 🎓 Strategic Context

ANDIE's cognitive runtime now has:

1. ✅ **Predictable lifecycle** — Initialization happens at app startup, not scattered across imports
2. ✅ **Testable state** — Fixtures can mock app.state before each test
3. ✅ **Observable startup** — Clear sequence of initialization steps for governance
4. ✅ **Distributed semantics** — State ownership per instance is explicit
5. ✅ **Deterministic behavior** — Telemetry identical across restart cycles

This is the **platform foundation** that higher-order autonomy depends on. Without deterministic lifecycle semantics, agent orchestration and distributed cognition become chaos. With it, we can reason about system behavior.
